COMMISSION agrees that C ONSULTANT shall have the right to control the \\nmanner and means of accomplishing the result contracted for herein. \\n  \\nPRINCIPAL TEST : The CONSULTANT rather than COMMISSION has the right to control the manner and \\nmeans of accomplishing the result contracted for. \\n SECONDARY FACTORS\\n: (a) The extent of control which, by agreement, COMMISSION may exercise \\nover the details of the work is slight rather than substantial; (b) CONSULTANT is engaged in a distinct \\noccupation or business; (c) In the locality, the work to be done by CONSULTANT is usually done by a \\nspecialist without supervision, rather than under the di rection of an employer; (d) The skill required in the \\nparticular occupation is substantia l rather than slight; (e) The CONS ULTANT rather than the COMMISSION \\nsupplies the instrumentalities, tools and work place;  (f) The length of time for which CONSULTANT is \\nengaged is of limited duration rather than indefinite ; (g) The method of payment of CONSULTANT is by the \\njob rather than by the time; (h) The work is part of a special or permissive activity, program, or project, rather \\nthan part of the regular business of COMMISSION; (i) CONSULTANT and COMMISSION believe they are \\ncreating an independent CONSULTANT relationship rather  than an employer-employee relationship; and (j) \\nThe COMMISSION conducts public business.  It is recognized that it is not necessary that all secondary factors support creation of an independent \\nCONSULTANT relationship, but rather that overall there are significant secondary factors which indicate \\nthat CONSULTANT is an independent CONSULTANT. \\n By their signatures to this Agreement, each of the un dersigned certifies that it is his or her considered \\njudgment that the CONSULTANT engaged under this Ag reement is in fact an independent CONSULTANT. \\n 12.
