## Document Question Answering & Summarization System

### Project Overview
This project implements a document processing system that can answer questions about uploaded documents and generate summaries. The system supports PDF, Word (.docx), and plain text (.txt) files, using state-of-the-art natural language processing models to provide accurate answers and concise summaries.

### Key Features
**1.Document Processing:**
Extracts text from PDF, Word, and plain text files
Handles multi-page documents seamlessly
**2.Question Answering:**
Uses DistilBERT model fine-tuned on SQuAD dataset
Provides answers with confidence scores
Shows answer location within the document
**3.Summarization:**
Utilizes Facebook's BART-large-CNN model
Generates concise summaries (30-150 words)
Preserves key information from documents
**4.User Interface:**

Intuitive Gradio web interface
o	Supports simultaneous question answering and summarization
o	Shows detailed output with confidence metrics
Technical Implementation
Core Components
1.	Text Extraction:
o	PyPDF2 for PDF processing
o	python-docx for Word document parsing
o	Native Python file handling for text files
2.	NLP Models:
o	distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad for question answering
o	facebook/bart-large-cnn for summarization
o	Both models run locally after initial download
3.	Web Interface:
o	Gradio for simple web app creation
o	File upload widget with format validation
o	Configurable options for question and summary
Key Functions
•	extract_text_from_file(): Handles document parsing for different formats
•	process_document(): Orchestrates QA and summarization tasks
•	Gradio interface: Provides user interaction layer

System Requirements
•	Python 3.7+
•	Required packages:
o	transformers
o	torch
o	gradio
o	PyPDF2
o	python-docx
Usage Guide
1.	Launch the application
2.	Upload a document (PDF, Word, or text file)
3.	Optionally enter a question about the document
4.	Check the "Generate Summary" box if you want a summary
5.	Click "Submit" to process the document
6.	View results in the output box
Performance Considerations
•	Initial model loading may take time (models are downloaded on first run)
•	Large documents may take longer to process
•	For production use, consider:
o	Adding document size limits
o	Implementing caching
o	Using GPU acceleration
o	Setting up a queuing system for multiple requests
Limitations
•	Current version is a demo with basic functionality
•	Accuracy depends on the pre-trained models
•	Very large documents may exceed memory limits
•	Complex formatting may not be preserved in text extraction

Future Enhancements
1.	Advanced Features:
o	Document chunking for large files
o	Multiple question processing
o	Customizable summary length
o	Support for more file formats (e.g., PPT, HTML)
2.	Performance Improvements:
o	Model quantization for faster inference
o	Batch processing capabilities
o	Asynchronous processing
3.	User Experience:
o	Progress indicators
o	History of previous queries
o	Export functionality for results
Conclusion
This Document Question Answering & Summarization System provides a powerful yet accessible tool for extracting information from documents. By combining state-of-the-art NLP models with a simple interface, it makes document analysis accessible to non-technical users while offering customization options for more advanced requirements.
The project demonstrates how modern NLP can be applied to practical document processing tasks, and serves as a foundation for more specialized document analysis applications.
